## 1.1.1
 * Set a maximum length on Singer Decimals, where a decimal past the cap is normalized via `decimal.normalize()` [#28](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-oracle/pull/28)

## 1.1.0

 * Increase default numeric scale from `6` to `38` [#24](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-oracle/pull/24)

 * Backwards incompatible change to the way that data types are discovered and parsed [#22](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-oracle/pull/22)
